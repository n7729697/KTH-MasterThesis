    \textbf{Risk} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Mitigation Strategy} \\ \hline
    Physical harm & Potential for the quadruped robot to cause physical harm to humans or the environment during testing & Implement safety measures, limit access to testing area, properly calibrate and test robot \\ \hline
    Data privacy and security & Risk of data breaches or unauthorized access to collected and processed data & Use encryption, access controls, and appropriate data protection measures \\ \hline
    Overfitting / underfitting & Possibility of inaccurate simulations and suboptimal results due to overfitting or underfitting of the data & Carefully select and design the surrogate model, use appropriate evaluation metrics \\ \hline
    Technical difficulties & Potential for technical difficulties or errors during implementation and training of the model-based \ac{RL} approach & Thoroughly understand the algorithms and methodologies, allocate additional time and resources to address any issues \\ \hline
