	abstract = {A running trot is shown in the above cartoon. The step sequence of the trot is shown at the right. The trot is a two-beat gait. Right and left diagonals alternate in supporting weight, i.e., the right forelimb and left hind limb move in unison as do left forelimb and right hind limb. The diagonal is named for the involved forelimb (right/left). Actually, the hind limb of the diagonal impacts slightly earlier than the fore limb, though they appear to impact simultaneously. The hind limb provides both vertical and forward propulsion. The trunk is carried rigidly, undergoing only vertical oscillations, and the neck and head are fixed in an upright position during the trot. In the running trot (quick trot; brisk trot; flying trot) a suspension phase intervenes between each diagonal support phase (illustrated above and left). As the stride is lengthened in the running trot, interference can become a problem (the hind paw hits the ipsilateral forelimb). To avoid interference, the fore paw must be lifted before the ipsilateral hind paw arrives, or the hind paw must land to the side of the fore paw, or the animal must resort to crab-running (trunk at an angle to the line of progression). In a slow trot, the suspension phase is absent, so the body is always supported by one diagonal or the other. If the support phase is prolonged and the swing phase is shortened, three-limb support may intervene between the diagonal support phases. The trot is a common gait in all domestic quadrupeds. It is well-suited for rough, irregular ground and for traveling long distances at a fair rate of speed. Work is spread evenly over all four limbs, and diagonal support makes it easy to maintain equilibrium. The trot is the natural foraging gait of most wild animals. Relative to other quadrupeds, the dog exhibits a greater variety of trot variations (dog-trot; thrown trot; swung trot). In a "dog-trot", the forelimb precedes the hindlimb at impact and lift. The German Shepherd typically exhibits suspension (running trot; flying trot) when it trots. It's long body and low center of gravity of precludes interference and the need for compensatory crab-running. The running trot is used by racing Standardbred horses. Interference is avoided by developing a long-bodied (long-coupled) horse, or the problem is minimized by using protective shoes.},

The reinforcement learning process can be trained quickly by ignoring the specific materials and structural properties of the soft robot.

	abstract = {Using soft actuators as legs, soft quadruped robots have shown great potential in traversing unstructured and complex terrains and environments. However, unlike rigid robots whose gaits can be generated using foot pattern design and kinematic model of the rigid legs, the gait generation of soft quadruped robots remains challenging due to the high DoFs of the soft actuators and the uncertain deformations during their contact with the ground. This study is based on a quadruped robot using four Compressible Tendon-driven Soft Actuators (CTSAs) as the legs, with the actuator's compression motion being utilized to improve the walking performance of the robot. For the gait design, an inverse kinematics model considering the compression of the CTSA is developed and validated in simulation. Based on this model, walking gaits realizing different motion speeds and directions are generated. Closed loop direction and speed controllers are developed for increasing the robustness and precision of the robot walking. Simulation and experimental results show that omnidirectional locomotion and complex walking tasks can be realized by tuning the gait parameters and the motions are resistant to external disturbances.},

Reinforcement learning has become a powerful tool to formulate controllers for legged robots. Learning multiple gaits and transitions, nevertheless, is related to the multi-task learning problems. In this work, we present a novel framework for training a simple control policy for a quadruped robot to locomote in various gaits. Four independent phases are used as the interface between the gait generator and the control policy, which characterizes the movement of four feet. Guided by the phases, the quadruped robot is able to locomote according to the generated gaits, such as walk, trot, pacing and bounding, and to make transitions among those gaits. More general phases can be used to generate complex gaits, such as mixed rhythmic dancing. With the control policy, the Black Panther robot, a medium-dog-sized quadruped robot, can perform all learned motor skills while following the velocity commands smoothly and robustly in natural environment.},

The transition model for the end-effector-to-dough interactions is learned from one hour of robot exploration, and doughs of different hydration levels are rolled out into varying lengths. Experimental results are encouraging, with the proposed framework accomplishing the task of rolling out dough into a specified length with 60\% fewer actions than a heuristic method. Furthermore, we show that estimating stiffness using the soft end-effector can be used to effectively initialize models, improving robot performance by approximately 40\% over incorrect model initialization.},

	abstract = {A fundamental problem in reinforcement learning is balancing exploration and exploitation. We address this problem in the context of model-based reinforcement learning in large stochastic relational domains by developing relational extensions of the concepts of the E3 and R-MAX algorithms. EfÔ¨Åcient exploration in exponentially large state spaces needs to exploit the generalization of the learned model: what in a propositional setting would be considered a novel situation and worth exploration may in the relational setting be a well-known context in which exploitation is promising. To address this we introduce relational count functions which generalize the classical notion of state and action visitation counts. We provide guarantees on the exploration efÔ¨Åciency of our framework using count functions under the assumption that we had a relational KWIK learner and a near-optimal planner. We propose a concrete exploration algorithm which integrates a practically efÔ¨Åcient probabilistic rule learner and a relational planner (for which there are no guarantees, however) and employs the contexts of learned relational rules as features to model the novelty of states and actions. Our results in noisy 3D simulated robot manipulation problems and in domains of the international planning competition demonstrate that our approach is more effective than existing propositional and factored exploration techniques.},

In this paper, we provide evidence for interlimb coordination during gait transitions using a quadruped robot for which coordination between the legs can be self-organized through a simple ‚Äúcentral pattern generator‚Äù (CPG) model. We demonstrate spontaneous gait transitions between energy-efficient patterns by changing only the parameter related to speed. Interlimb coordination was achieved with the use of local load sensing only without any preprogrammed patterns. Our model exploits
              physical communication

This pattern of movement is found in fungal hyphae, developing neurons, and trailing plants, and is characterized by extension from the tip of the body, length change of hundreds of percent, and active control of growth direction. This results in the abilities to move through tightly constrained environments and form useful three-dimensional structures from the body. We report a class of soft pneumatic robot that is capable of a basic form of this behavior, growing substantially in length from the tip while actively controlling direction using onboard sensing of environmental stimuli; further, the peak rate of lengthening is comparable to rates of animal and robot locomotion. This is enabled by two principles: Pressurization of an inverted thin-walled vessel allows rapid and substantial lengthening of the tip of the robot body, and controlled asymmetric lengthening of the tip allows directional control. Further, we demonstrate the abilities to lengthen through constrained environments by exploiting passive deformations and form three-dimensional structures by lengthening the body of the robot along a path.

They not only see but also feel their actions. Most current robotic learning methodologies exploit recent progress in computer vision and deep learning to acquire data-hungry pixel-to-action policies. These methodologies do not exploit intuitive latent structure in physics or tactile signatures. Tactile reasoning is omnipresent in the animal kingdom, yet it is underdeveloped in robotic manipulation. Tactile stimuli are only acquired through invasive interaction, and interpretation of the data stream together with visual stimuli is challenging. Here, we propose a methodology to emulate hierarchical reasoning and multisensory fusion in a robot that learns to play Jenga, a complex game that requires physical interaction to be played effectively. The game mechanics were formulated as a generative process using a temporal hierarchical Bayesian model, with representations for both behavioral archetypes and noisy block states. This model captured descriptive latent structures, and the robot learned probabilistic models of these relationships in force and visual domains through a short exploration phase. Once learned, the robot used this representation to infer block behavior patterns and states as it played the game. Using its inferred beliefs, the robot adjusted its behavior with respect to both its current actions and its game strategy, similar to the way humans play the game. We evaluated the performance of the approach against three standard baselines and show its fidelity on a real-world implementation of the game.},

	abstract = {As an important basic component of quadruped robots, mechanical legs provide the robots with excellent maneuverability and versatility, which determine the core application performance such as job adaptability, walking speed, and load capacity. A large number of robotics institutes for the last few decades have studied mechanical legs used by quadruped robots and published many research results. In this article, we collect these research results and classify them into three categories (prismatic legs, articulated legs, and redundant articulated legs) according to the degrees of freedom and then introduce and analyze them. On this basis, we summarize and study the design methods of the actuators and mechanical leg structures. Finally, we make some suggestions for the development of quadruped robot?s legs in the future. The motivation of this review is to summarize and analyze previous research efforts and provide useful guidance for future robotic designers to develop more efficient mechanical legs of quadruped robots.},

	abstract = {Soft robots are considered intrinsically safe with regard to human?robot interaction. This has motivated the development and investigation of soft medical robots, such as soft robotic gloves for stroke rehabilitation. However, the output force of conventional purely soft actuators is usually limited. This restricts their application in stroke rehabilitation, which requires a large force and bidirectional movement. In addition, accurate control of soft actuators is difficult owing to the nonlinearity of purely soft actuators. In this study, a soft robotic glove is designed based on a soft-elastic composite actuator (SECA) that integrates an elastic torque compensating layer to increase the output force as well as achieving bidirectional movement. Such a hybrid design also significantly reduces the degree of nonlinearity compared with a purely soft actuator. A model-based online learning and adaptive control algorithm is proposed for the wearable soft robotic glove, taking its interaction environment into account, namely, the human hand/finger. The designed hybrid controller enables the soft robotic glove to adapt to different hand conditions for reference tracking. Experimental results show that satisfactory tracking performance can be achieved on both healthy subjects and stroke subjects (with the tracking root mean square error (RMSE) {\textless} 0.05 rad). Meanwhile, the controller can output an actuator?finger model for each individual subject (with the learning error RMSE {\textless} 0.06 rad), which provides information on the condition of the finger and, thus, has further potential clinical application.},

This paper proposes a new design of quadruped robots using soft actuators driven by tendons as the four legs. Compared to the rigid robots, the proposed soft quadruped robot has inherent safety, less weight and simpler mechanism for fabrication and control, but the corresponding challenge is that the accurate mathematical model applicable to model-based control design of the soft robot is difficult to derive by dynamics. To synthesize the optimal gait controller of the soft-legged robot, the paper makes the following contributions. First, the flexible components of the quadruped robot are modeled with different finite element and lumped parameter methods. The model accuracy and computation efficiency are analyzed. Second, soft actor‚Äìcritic methods and curriculum learning are applied to learn the optimal gaits for different walking tasks. Third, The learned gaits are implemented in an in-house robot to transport hand tools. Preliminary results show that the robot can walk forward and correct the walking directions.},

In this study, various popular reinforcement learning (RL) methods are applied to address the problem of online and adaptive model-free control of 4D printed shape memory polymer (SMP). Their training efficiencies are compared and an adaptive LQR controller based on Q learning is developed to realize efficient online learning. The RL controller achieves precise and quick shape control within 2‚àí‚àí3 learning episodes and is adaptive to the changing properties of SMP. The RL controller performance is then compared with a model-based LQR controller and shows high control precision and excellent adaptability to the varying control plant.},

Improving measurement accuracy for sensors with hysteresis is a common challenge. Current studies mainly apply complex models and highly nonlinear functions to characterize the hysteresis, requiring a complicated parameter identification process and challenging real-time applications. This study enhances the model simplicity and the real-time performance for the hysteresis characterization. We identify the hysteresis by combining multiple polynomial functions and improving the sensor estimation with the proposed MH-EKF. We examine the performance of the filter in the real-time closed-loop control system.

	abstract = {Legged robots that can operate autonomously in remote and hazardous environments will greatly increase opportunities for exploration into underexplored areas. Exteroceptive perception is crucial for fast and energy-efficient locomotion: Perceiving the terrain before making contact with it enables planning and adaptation of the gait ahead of time to maintain speed and stability. However, using exteroceptive perception robustly for locomotion has remained a grand challenge in robotics. Snow, vegetation, and water visually appear as obstacles on which the robot cannot step or are missing altogether due to high reflectance. In addition, depth perception can degrade due to difficult lighting, dust, fog, reflective or transparent surfaces, sensor occlusion, and more. For this reason, the most robust and general solutions to legged locomotion to date rely solely on proprioception. This severely limits locomotion speed because the robot has to physically feel out the terrain before adapting its gait accordingly. Here, we present a robust and general solution to integrating exteroceptive and proprioceptive perception for legged locomotion. We leverage an attention-based recurrent encoder that integrates proprioceptive and exteroceptive input. The encoder is trained end to end and learns to seamlessly combine the different perception modalities without resorting to heuristics. The result is a legged locomotion controller with high robustness and speed. The controller was tested in a variety of challenging natural and urban environments over multiple seasons and completed an hour-long hike in the Alps in the time recommended for human hikers.

Being fundamentally different from traditional rigid robots, soft robots exhibit properties of infinite degrees of freedom (DOF) and nonlinear materials properties that require innovations in control systems. With the rapid development of materials science, robotics, and artificial intelligence, the diversification of actuator mechanisms and algorithms has enabled a wide range of unique control strategies. This review summarizes the basics of actuator mechanisms and control strategies, including open-loop control, closed-loop control, and autonomous control, and discusses their implementation from diversified perspectives. Control strategies are evaluated based on their compatibility with materials sets, application goals, and implementation route. The emerging directions are forecasted from the perspectives of interfacing between controller and actuator, underactuated control strategies, and implementation of artificial intelligence (AI).},

It is fairly common for authors to experiment with self-designed environments, and there are several separate lines of research, which are sometimes closed-sourced or not reproducible. Accordingly, it is an open question how these various existing MBRL algorithms perform relative to each other. To facilitate research in MBRL, in this paper we gather a wide collection of MBRL algorithms and propose over 18 benchmarking environments specially designed for MBRL. We benchmark these algorithms with unified problem settings, including noisy environments. Beyond cataloguing performance, we explore and unify the underlying algorithmic differences across MBRL algorithms. We characterize three key research challenges for future MBRL research: the dynamics bottleneck, the planning horizon dilemma, and the early-termination dilemma. Finally, to maximally facilitate future research on MBRL, we open-source our benchmark in http://www.cs.toronto.edu/{\textasciitilde}tingwuwang/mbrl.html.},

There are several advantages of soft robots compared to the conventional robots; safe human-machine interaction, adaptability to wearable devices, simple gripping system, and so on. Due to the unique features and advantages, soft robots have a considerable range of applications. This article reviews state-of-the-art researches on soft robots and application areas. Actuation systems for soft robots can be categorized and analyzed into three types: variable length tendon, fluidic actuation, and electro-active polymer (EAP). The deformable property of soft robots restricts the use of many conventional rigid sensors such as encoders, strain gauges, or inertial measurement units. Thus, contactless approaches for sensing and/or sensors with low modulus are preferable for soft robots. Sensors include low modulus ({\textless} 1 MPa) elastomers with liquid-phase material filled channels and are appropriate for proprioception which is determined by the degree of curvature. In control perspective, novel control idea should be developed because the conventional control techniques may be inadequate to handle soft robots. Several innovative techniques and diverse materials \& fabrication methods are described in this review article. In addition, a wide range of soft robots are characterized and analyzed based on the following sub-categories; actuation, sensing, structure, control and electronics, materials, fabrication and system, and applications.},

	abstract = {Soft robots are a group of robots made from highly compliant materials. Compared to their rigid counterparts, soft robots show better mobility and stronger adaptability to the environment. Specifically, soft quadruped robots, using four soft actuators as robot legs, have become a popular design, and are proven to be feasible and reliable in performing soft locomotion. Traditional soft quadruped robots are actuated using pneumatic forces which require high pressure sources. Additionally, the travel range of these robots are limited. This paper proposes a new design of soft quadruped robot that is fully actuated with electric motors. The main components of the robot are 3D printed and can be easily assembled. The four soft legs of the robot are modeled with experimental data and a closed loop controller is developed to regulate the deformation and motion. The legs can perform complex movement which enables the quadruped robot to move with different gaits.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989652},
	abstract = {Soft robots have recently demonstrated impressive abilities to adapt to objects and their environment with limited sensing and actuation. However, mobile soft robots are typically fabricated using laborious molding processes that result in limited actuated degrees of freedom and hence limited locomotion capabilities. In this paper, we present a 3D printed robot with bellowed soft legs capable of rotation about two axes. This allows our robot to navigate rough terrain that previously posed a significant challenge to soft robots. We present models and FEM simulations for the soft leg modules and predict the robot locomotion capabilities. We use finite element analysis to simulate the actuation characteristics of these modules. We then compared the analytical and computational results to experimental results with a tethered prototype. The experimental soft robot is capable of lifting its legs 5.3 cm off the ground and is able to walk at speeds up to 20 mm/s (0.13 bl/s). This work represents a practical approach to the design and fabrication of functional mobile soft robots.},

	abstract = {To solve tasks in complex environments, robots need to learn from experience. Deep reinforcement learning is a common approach to robot learning but requires a large amount of trial and error to learn, limiting its deployment in the physical world. As a consequence, many advances in robot learning rely on simulators. On the other hand, learning inside of simulators fails to capture the complexity of the real world, is prone to simulator inaccuracies, and the resulting behaviors do not adapt to changes in the world. The Dreamer algorithm has recently shown great promise for learning from small amounts of interaction by planning within a learned world model, outperforming pure reinforcement learning in video games. Learning a world model to predict the outcomes of potential actions enables planning in imagination, reducing the amount of trial and error needed in the real environment. However, it is unknown whether Dreamer can facilitate faster learning on physical robots. In this paper, we apply Dreamer to 4 robots to learn online and directly in the real world, without simulators. Dreamer trains a quadruped robot to roll off its back, stand up, and walk from scratch and without resets in only 1 hour. We then push the robot and find that Dreamer adapts within 10 minutes to withstand perturbations or quickly roll over and stand back up. On two different robotic arms, Dreamer learns to pick and place multiple objects directly from camera images and sparse rewards, approaching human performance. On a wheeled robot, Dreamer learns to navigate to a goal position purely from camera images, automatically resolving ambiguity about the robot orientation. Using the same hyperparameters across all experiments, we find that Dreamer is capable of online learning in the real world, establishing a strong baseline. We release our infrastructure for future applications of world models to robot learning.},

	abstract = {Designing agile locomotion for quadruped robots often requires extensive expertise and tedious manual tuning. In this paper, we present a system to automate this process by leveraging deep reinforcement learning techniques. Our system can learn quadruped locomotion from scratch using simple reward signals. In addition, users can provide an open loop reference to guide the learning process when more control over the learned gait is needed. The control policies are learned in a physics simulator and then deployed on real robots. In robotics, policies trained in simulation often do not transfer to the real world. We narrow this reality gap by improving the physics simulator and learning robust policies. We improve the simulation using system identification, developing an accurate actuator model and simulating latency. We learn robust controllers by randomizing the physical environments, adding perturbations and designing a compact observation space. We evaluate our system on two agile locomotion gaits: trotting and galloping. After learning in simulation, a quadruped robot can successfully perform both gaits in the real world.},

	abstract = {There are currently many quadruped robots suited to a wide range of applications, but traversing some terrains, such as vertical ladders, remains an open challenge. There is still a need to develop adaptive robots that can walk and climb efficiently. This paper presents an adaptive quadruped robot that, by mimicking feline structure, supports several novel capabilities. We design a novel paw structure and several point-cloud-based sensory structures incorporating a quad-composite time-of-flight sensor and a dual-laser range finder. The proposed robot is equipped with physical and cognitive capabilities which include: 1) a dynamic-density topological map building with attention model, 2) affordance perception using the topological map, and 3) a neural-based locomotion model. The novel capabilities show strong integration between locomotion and internal‚Äìexternal sensory information, enabling short-term adaptations in response to environmental changes. The robot performed well in several situations: walking on natural terrain, walking with a leg malfunction, avoiding a sudden obstacle, climbing a vertical ladder. Further, we consider current problems and future development.},

Model predictive control (MPC), as the prime methodology for constrained control, offers a significant opportunity to exploit the abundance of data in a reliable manner, particularly while taking safety constraints into account. This review aims at summarizing and categorizing previous research on learning-based MPC, i.e., the integration or combination of MPC with learning methods, for which we consider three main categories. Most of the research addresses learning for automatic improvement of the prediction model from recorded data. There is, however, also an increasing interest in techniques to infer the parameterization of the MPC controller, i.e., the cost and constraints, that lead to the best closed-loop performance. Finally, we discuss concepts that leverage MPC to augment learning-based controllers with constraint satisfaction properties.},
