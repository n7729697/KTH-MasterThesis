\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Future Work}

An intriguing fact of our approach resides in the capacity to tailor the controller's behavior to various task objectives through the manipulation of distinct reward functions within the RL framework. By delineating specific reward functions, the RL algorithm learns to optimize the controller for diverse tasks of interest. This adaptability renders the methodology versatile and applicable to a spectrum of scenarios, allowing the robotic system to be endowed with a repertoire of task-specific skills.
