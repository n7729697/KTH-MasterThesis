\section{Discussion}
In summary, this research endeavor has sought to unravel the complexities surrounding gait control in soft quadruped robots, with the goal of enhancing understanding and paving the way for more effective control strategies. A systematic exploration of the research questions outlined in this study has yielded valuable insights and findings that contribute significantly to the field of robotics and autonomous locomotion. Additionally, this section will conduct a comprehensive discussion of the research questions outlined in the introduction, with the aim of providing answers and insights based on the research conducted in this study.

\subsection{Answer to Research Questions 1}
The investigation into restricting the state space and designing a surrogate model with high estimation accuracy was instrumental in the pursuit of efficient and accurate simulations and training for soft quadruped robots. This research sought to address this question through two distinct approaches: pattern-defined reinforcement learning and parameterization. These methods provide a solid foundation for efficient and accurate simulations and training, ultimately leading to improved gait control strategies, as shown in Section \ref{Sec:MBRL}. 

The concept of pattern-defined reinforcement learning showed promise as a means to restrict the state space efficiently. By selecting a subset of features based on specific patterns, such as the trot, the study aimed to simplify the state space while retaining essential information. This approach represents a significant step towards efficient simulations and training.

Parameterization introduced a higher-level abstraction into the state-action space by using phases between gait and real motors to parameterize the gaits of quadruped robots. This approach, while complex, holds the potential to simplify the representation of the state space. It has the advantage of capturing critical information about locomotion while streamlining the learning process.

Additionally, it's important to acknowledge the inherent challenges posed by the interconnected nature of the robot's legs. This unique characteristic of soft quadruped robots introduces constraints on the diversity of gaits that can be studied. Unlike robots with independently movable legs, soft quadrupeds exhibit a more synchronized form of locomotion due to their interconnected structure. This limitation restricts the robot's capability to perform certain types of locomotion that may be relevant in real-world scenarios, where adaptability is key.

Given these constraints, our research approach pivoted towards a practical evaluation methodology that prioritized the tangible impact of controllers on the robot's performance in real-world applications. Rather than delving into the intricacies of algorithms in isolation, we directed our focus towards assessing how these controllers influence the robot's stability, walking speed, and cost-of-transport. These metrics serve as practical indicators of a controller's effectiveness in real-world contexts, aligning our research with the practical needs of the field.

This shift in emphasis allowed us to bridge the gap between theoretical developments and real-world deployment, ensuring that our research contributes directly to the enhancement of soft quadruped robots' capabilities in practical scenarios. In essence, our approach recognized the correlation of algorithm design and real-world performance, striving for a holistic understanding of gait control in these unique robotic systems.

\subsection{Answer to Research Questions 2}
Furthermore, the comparative analysis between model-based and model-free reinforcement learning approaches has shed light on the potential of the former in generating superior control agents for soft quadruped robots. The enhancements in stability, walking speed, and cost-of-transport underscore the significance of model-based reinforcement learning as a benchmark in this project. The careful consideration of trade-offs among learning efficiency, simulation accuracy, and long-term planning accuracy has provided essential insights into the quest for optimal gait control policies.

An intriguing fact of our approach resides in the capacity to tailor the controller's behavior to various task objectives through the manipulation of distinct reward functions within the RL framework. By delineating specific reward functions, the RL algorithm learns to optimize the controller for diverse tasks of interest. This adaptability renders the methodology versatile and applicable to a spectrum of scenarios, allowing the robotic system to be endowed with a repertoire of task-specific skills.


\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, this study embarked on an exploration of enhancing learning efficiency in the context of optimal gait control for soft quadruped robots, with a primary emphasis on addressing the challenges through a MBRL approach. The overall objective was to develop robust gait control policies capable of accommodating the continuous and deformable morphology of the robot while contributing to the advancement of RL control strategies for real-world applications. To substantiate the theoretical framework and proposed methodologies, a series of experimental tests were conducted, ensuring the practical applicability of the research findings. Additionally, a tailored software architecture designed specifically for the soft quadruped robot, SoftQ, was introduced to facilitate the research's objectives.

Nonetheless, it is imperative to acknowledge certain limitations and delimitations that influenced the study's scope. The "sim-to-real gap" constraint underscored the challenges associated with translating simulation results to real-world scenarios, reinforcing the need for a practical evaluation of the proposed gait control strategies. Moreover, the interconnected nature of the robot's legs imposed constraints on the variety of gaits that could be studied, limiting the exploration of certain locomotion strategies relevant to real-world contexts. These limitations necessitated an evaluation focused on the practical impact of controllers on the robot's stability, walking speed, and cost-of-transport, rather than delving into algorithm intricacies.

Delimitations were intentionally set to maintain a concentrated focus on soft quadruped robots, excluding other robotic categories, external environmental factors, hardware design variations, and alternative RL algorithms. This deliberate narrowing of scope aimed to foster an in-depth analysis of the specific challenges related to gait control in the chosen context.

The research methodology encompassed stages of data collection, model-based RL algorithm development, evaluation, analysis, and validation, culminating in the comparison of model-based and model-free RL approaches. Practical validation through physical implementation on SoftQ ensured the relevance of the findings in real-world scenarios. The project also acknowledged ethical and sustainability considerations, emphasizing the responsible use of robotics technology and environmentally-conscious design choices.

In essence, this study contributes to the advancement of soft quadruped robotics by proposing an MBRL approach to gait control, with practical validation underscoring its potential for real-world applications. It is anticipated that the insights gained from this research will pave the way for more efficient and effective RL control strategies, ultimately enhancing the capabilities of soft quadruped robots in various domains, while remaining mindful of ethical and sustainability concerns.
