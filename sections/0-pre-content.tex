Quadruped robots shared advantages of maneuverability in complex terrain without human effort, for instance, they can provide greater absorption capacity, allowing the robot to better withstand impacts and shocks. While rigid robots are known for their fast response and motion accuracy, they may be limited in their motion range due to their rigid mechanical structures, such as joints and electric motors. Recently, advances in sensors, actuators, and computers have made it possible to control soft quadruped robots in real life easily.
